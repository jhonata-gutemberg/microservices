# Microservices

## About
Microservices is an architectural style where a software system is built as a collection of small, independent services 
that communicate with each other, typically over a network (e.g., HTTP or messaging queues).

Each microservice is:

* Focused on a single business capability (e.g., user service, payment service)
* Independently deployable and scalable
* Developed and maintained by a small, autonomous team
* Loosely coupled with other services
* Often has its own database and data model

### Benefits
* Easier to scale, deploy, and maintain each part of the system independently
* Encourages modularity and team ownership
* Improves fault isolation (failure in one service doesn't crash the whole system)

### Challenges
* Complexity in communication between services
* Requires robust monitoring, logging, and DevOps
* Data consistency can be harder to manage (eventual consistency is common)
